# Configuration files for the X Window manager

## Installation
Not really an installation. Just create a soft link from the files to the hidden version in the home directory.

I.e.

ln -s $HOME/Development/dotfiles/X/Xdefaults $HOME/.Xdefaults

ln -s $HOME/Development/dotfiles/X/Xresources $HOME/.Xresources
